# Bulk file imports in CSV format via FTP or Shopgate Admin

## Introduction

This article covers how to upload catalog data as CSV into the Shopgate system including the file formats and how to check for errors.

**Note:** As this is a simplified format that does not support all features, it is only recommended for specific use cases or to get a quick start.

There are to way to insert new catalog data into the Shopgate system via CSV:

- drag and drop import in the Shopgate Admin
- ftp import

### Partial Import

All the imports done as CSV Uploads are partial imports. This means the set of entries in the CSV Files are treated as an update subset of the whole data at Shopgate. This means you need to specify which entities in retail red should be deleted and which entities should get added or updated.

JSON imports also support full import: you provide the full list of entities and the import process figures out which to delete.

## CSV Import Via Admin

The _Catalog_ > _Upload Data_ tab allows you to easily upload category, product, and inventory information.

Once you have properly formatted your CSV files, simply drag and drop each file into the appropriate box to upload your data. The data begins to process immediately and may take up to 15 minutes. Once the upload completes, details for the category, product, and inventory are available in their respective tabs.

You can specify the import strategy per file via the dropdown menu `import type`. Here you can choose between incremental (partial) and full import.

## CSV Import Via FTP

Before you're able to upload the CSV files over ftp, you need to get the address as well as the credentials. Both can be found in the Shopgate Admin in _Settings_ > _Imports_. Until stated otherwise in the Admin the address is:

```
Address: ftp.shopgate.io
Port: 21
Protocol: FTPS
```

On the same spot in the Admin you can find your credentials including the option to reset your password.

After connecting with the ftp server you will be presented with the following directory structure:

```
catalog
  default
    complete
    error
inventory
  complete
  error
```

To import a csv file you need to upload into a certain directory dedicated to the entity. For example:

- **Product** and **category** files need to be placed into **/catalog/default**
- The **inventory** file needs to be uploaded to the **/inventory** directory

After the upload the file will be processed. Is the processing done, you can find the file you uploaded in the complete subdirectory. In case of errors the error subdirectory will hold a file with the errors that occured during processing.

**Attention**: For the FTP import the files need to comply with the following convention:

- **\<products|categories>(\_fullimport)\_YYYYMMDD.csv**
- **inventory(\_fullimport(\_location\_\<locationCode>))\_YYYYMMDD.csv**

This convention allows you to specifify if it is a full or partial import (omitting \_fullimport will result in a patial import).

Examples:

- **products\_20200220.csv**<br>partial import of products
- **categories_fullimport\_20200220.csv**<br>full import of categories
- **inventory\_20200220.csv**<br>partial import of inventory
- **inventory_fullimport_location_loc1\_20200220.csv**<br>fullimport of inventories for location loc1

> **NOTE:** only inventory supports the location exclusive upload. Also specifying the location is only works with full imports.

## Formatting the CSV Files

You can upload the catalog data via a CSV file, using any inventory system. To prepare the CSV files to upload, you must follow the expected format. Click _Download CSV_ to view the sample CSV files that show you how to format your data. Field names are not case sensitive. If this is your first time uploading content, begin with the Category Upload and then proceed in order to the Product and Inventory uploads.

Note that each catalog entry contains the following field:

- `Import Type`: Indicates if record (row) is an "Add / Change” or "Delete." A value of "AC" indicates that the record should be added if it is not already present or updated if it is already present. A value of "D" indicates that the record should be deleted from the system. If you do not provide a value for this field, the import type will default to “AC.”

### Category CSV

The Category CSV establishes the framework for uploading products and inventory. These categories are required to create a product taxonomy so customers can browse the catalog. Most ecommerce and POS systems have an existing taxonomy you can export.

[English Example](https://data.shopgate.com/example_files/category_example.csv), [German Example](https://data.shopgate.com/example_files/category_example_de.csv)

| FieldName           | Required | Type        | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                    |

### Product CSV

The Product CSV provides key information about each product. Each row represents a product record. Every product variant requires its own record entry. Configurable products can have up to three options (e.g. size, material, color).

## Download Catalog Data

When you click on a "Download" link under category or products, you will trigger a new export to be created. The export can take several minutes to complete depending on the size of the catalog, however once complete you will receive an email with a link to download the file. This will be in the same file used for uploading CSV into the Shopgate platform.

## Check Processed Import

Sometimes the CSV file content is not consistent, maybe entities relationships can't be resolved and the import produces errors. For those kind of issues you can check the metrics of the import that has been processed.

In order to check the import logs navigate to _Settings > Imports_ and click on the import in the import list. On the detail view you can find the review logs button. **Note:** Logs for an import are only visible for 14 Days.
